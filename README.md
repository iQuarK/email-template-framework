## Set up the framework
Just run:
    `$ npm install`

## How to create a template
 - 1. Create all the HTML file in `./templates`, putting all the styles inside the <styles> tag.  You have a sample in the commented directory.
 - 2. Run the following (where *index* is the file name without the `.html`):
    `$ node app.js index`
 - 3. The result (if everything goes OK) will be at `./dist` with the same file name.
